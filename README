  [1] Description
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

whatsnewfm is a utility to filter the daily newsletter from
www.freshmeat.net

The main purpose is to cut the hughe newsletter to a smaller size by
only showing items that you didn't see before.

The items already seen will be stored in a database. After some time,
the items expire and will be shown again the next time they are
included in a newsletter.

If you find an item that you consider particularly useful, you can add
it to a 'hot' list. Items in the hot list are checked for updates so
that you don't miss anything about your favourite programs.



  [2] Requirements
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* procmail or something else (otherwise you will have to send every
                              newsletter through the filter by hand)

* perl, sendmail, date



  [3] Usage
  ~~~~~~~~~

1) Edit the variables at the top of the whatsnewfm.pl script.

2) Create thw empty databases with
   "touch /path/to/database-hot /path/to/database-old"

3) Add the following lines to your .procmailrc to send all newsletters
   through the whatsnewfm filter:

:0 w :
* ^Subject:.\[fm-news\].newsletter
* !^X-Loop:.*whatsnewfm
| /path/to/whatsnewfm.pl

4) If you're not yet subscribed to the freshmeat newsletter, do so at
   http://www.freshmeat.net 

5) If one of the new applications is interesting to you, then add
   it's "magic id" to the "hot" database. Just enter the number on a
   new line. If you want to have comments in this database (eg the
   names of the applications) then write a tab (\t) after "magic id"
   followed by anything you want.

* Michael Reinsch <mr@uue.org> for keeping on asking and not being

  version 0.0.2.
