  [1] Description
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

whatsnewfm is a utility to filter the daily newsletter from
www.freshmeat.net

The main purpose is to cut the hughe newsletter to a smaller size by
only showing items that you didn't see before.

The items already seen will be stored in a database. After some time,
the items expire and will be shown again the next time they are
included in a newsletter.

If you find an item that you consider particularly useful, you can add
it to a "hot" list. Items in the hot list are checked for updates so
that you don't miss anything about your favourite programs.



  [2] Requirements
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* procmail or something else (otherwise you will have to send every
                              newsletter through the filter by hand)

* perl, sendmail, date



  [3] Usage
  ~~~~~~~~~

1) Edit the variables at the top of the whatsnewfm.pl script.

2) Create the empty databases with
   "touch /path/to/database-hot /path/to/database-old"

3) Add the following lines to your .procmailrc to send all newsletters
   through the whatsnewfm filter:

:0 w :
* ^Subject:.\[fm-news\].newsletter
* !^X-Loop:.*whatsnewfm
| /path/to/whatsnewfm.pl

4) If you're not yet subscribed to the freshmeat newsletter, do so at
   http://www.freshmeat.net 

5) If one of the new applications is interesting to you, then add
   it to your "hot" database. See [4] for details.



  [4] The "hot" database
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This database contains the applications that you are interested
in. You will be informed of every update within these applications.
The applications are identified by the "magic id" that is shown in the
parsed freshmeat newsletter.

To see what is in the database, just use "less" or "cat" on the
database file. To edit the database, please use the whatsnewfm
commands as shown below - don't edit the files with a text
editor. Some strange things might happen when you edit the database
while whatsnewfm is running in the background (your text editor won't
recognize a lock on the database).

These examples use the magic id 964023450 - it's the id of whatsnewfm
itself.



To add an application to the database, just type this:

  whatsnewfm.pl add 964023450

You can enter a comment (eg the name of the application) to help you
remembering which id is which application:

  whatsnewfm.pl add 964023450 whatsnewfm

If you want to enter multiple applications (eg copy'n'paste while
reading the new freshmeat newsletter) you can start whatsnewfm like
this:

  whatsnewfm.pl add

whatsnewfm.pl then reads from stdin. Every line must begin with a
magic id. Comments might follow after a whitespace character (space,
tab or the like). If you're finished, press CTRL-D. All entered
applications will be added to the "hot" database.



Deleting applications is as easy as adding applications. You can give
the magic id's directly (just one or even more):

  whatsnewfm.pl del 964023450

You can also give the ids on stdin (like the add command):

  whatsnewfm.pl del

This time multiple ids are allowed on one line when they are separated
by whitespaces.



  [5] Importing a watchfm database
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the watchfm_convert.pl script to insert your watchfm
database into your whatsnewfm database.

If all the entries in the watchfm database are yours, just do this:

  watchfm_convert.pl < /path/to/watchfm.db | whatsnewfm.pl add

If multiple persons are in the watchfm database, you have to grep all
the applications that are 'yours':

  grep 'yourem@ail.adress' /path/to/watchfm.db | watchfm_convert.pl | \
  whatsnewfm.pl add

  [7] Thanks
  ~~~~~~~~~~

* Michael Reinsch <mr@uue.org> for keeping on asking and not being
  convinced by my wrong thoughts. Only because of him versions beyond
  v0.0.1 do exist.
  


  [8] To do
  ~~~~~~~~~

* create backup only when there have been changes (like watchfm)

* what to do when the same item is twice in a letter?

* provide an option not to skip messages with high urgency
